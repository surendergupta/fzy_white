									<h3>FZY Business</h3>
									<p>The dynamics to preserve a fixed number of coins determine the distribution
of the coins. In the purview of dynamics the circulation and consumption are
determined too. The original value of the token supported by transactional
values play an important role to determine the quantity of Fizzyfy ( FZY ) coin
release in the market.
</p>
									<p>The token dynamics have four major factors:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>The content providers or creators</li>
										<li>The service providers who route the content to end users via their high end devices</li>
										<li>Facilitators who put their stakes to facilitate the platform to deliver</li>
										<li>The end users who ultimately transact in token s to avail the services of content provider</li>
									</ol>
									<p>All the four factors are able to earn their compensation or pay usage fees in terms of token transacted</p>

									<h3>Utility</h3>
									<p>Utility tokens are used to provide services within a network. For example, they might be used to purchase services, pay network fees, or redeem rewards. Unlike security tokens, utility tokens do not pay out dividends or part with an ownership stake. FZY, which is used to purchase storage space on a network, is an example of a utility token.</p>
